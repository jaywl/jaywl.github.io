I study the ecology and evolution of sociality. By exploring natural variation in collective behavior, I aim to illuminate the role that sociality plays in the evolution and diversification of life. To achieve this goal, I draw on highly interdisciplinary training to blend careful observational and experimental study with large-scale comparative analyses, often leveraging cutting edge computational and modeling methods. This line of research has led me to work on many systems; from bird song in hybrid zones, to brain regions in lab mice, to human infecious disease, to schooling in fish, I try to understand the particular details so that I can draw generally applicable conclusions about broad-scale processes. In addition to research, I am committed to fostering an understanding of the complexities of science in the general population, and so I spend time teaching, mentoring, and reaching out to the general population. To learn more, please see the other pages on this site and contact me with any questions.

Cheers,
