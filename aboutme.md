I study the ecology and evolution of sociality through the lens of collective behavior.


### My story

I have a BS in Ecology from the University of Georgia (2010) and a PhD in Biology from the University of Utah (2019). I have postdoctoral experience in systems neuroscience, infectious disease epidemiology, and computational biology, focused on collective behavior. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computational Biology at Cornell University.
